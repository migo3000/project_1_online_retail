Impact of COVID-19 on In-Store and E-commerce Sales
Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global economies and consumer behaviors, leading to a significant shift in the retail landscape. E-commerce, in particular, has experienced accelerated growth as lockdowns, social distancing measures, and changes in consumer preferences have driven more people to shop online. This project aims to analyze the performance of e-commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing it with the performance of traditional brick-and-mortar stores, to understand the broader implications for the retail industry.
Scope:
This project will focus on the following key areas:
Pre COVID-19 Trend:
	◦	Establish a baseline by analyzing e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail performance before the pandemic (2019 and earlier).
Impact During COVID-19:
	◦	Examine the changes in consumer behavior and retail sales during the peak of the pandemic (2020-2021), highlighting key trends and growth areas in e-commerce.
Post COVID-19 Trend:
	◦	Analyze the performance of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores in the aftermath of the pandemic, identifying lasting changes and new trends in the retail industry.
Comparative Analysis:
	◦	Perform a comparative analysis of e-commerce and traditional retail sales across the three phases (pre, during, and post-COVID-19) to quantify the impact of the pandemic on both sectors.
Geographical Insights:
	◦	Provide regional insights to identify variations in the impact of COVID-19 on retail sales performance across different areas.

Research Questions: 
In this project, we will address key questions such as:
	•	How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the performance of e-commerce compared to traditional brick-and-mortar retail?
	•	What are the long-term implications for consumer behavior in the retail industry?
	•	What were the most and least pandemic-sensitive industries?

Conclusion:
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on retail sales, focusing on the shift from in-store to e-commerce. It includes pre, during, and post-pandemic trend analyses, comparative studies, and geographical insights, using data from statistica.ca and custom CSV files. The findings highlight the adaptability of retail and the importance of hybrid shopping models.
